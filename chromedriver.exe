In web scraping with Selenium, the ChromeDriver is used to interact with the Google Chrome web browser programmatically

How It Works
You download ChromeDriver, which is a small executable that interacts with the Chrome browser.
You tell Selenium where the ChromeDriver is located.
Selenium uses this driver to open the browser and execute actions on a webpage.
